# How to Use:  

Use the time slider to control the range of time for both visualizations  
Use the textbox to input a hashtag to track over the selected date range (note: most hashtags do not have enough data to visualize, use \#coronavirus for a good test case)  
The hashtag visualization only updates when *clicking* the Submit button and after changing the date range
